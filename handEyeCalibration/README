Output (command line):
Theta_X
	Orientation of Camera Frame with respect to Robot tool-tip frame.
b_X
	Translation of Camera Frame with respect to Robot tool-tip frame.
	
Parameters:
squares_per_column
	Checkerboard squares per column 
squares_per_row
	Checkerboard squares per row
square_size
	Checkerboard square size in meters
	
Running the calibration: 
	0. Rigidly place the checkerboard in the visible range of the handEye (robot-camera) sensor.
	1. Make sure the ./launch/camera.launch file will work for your camera. 
		If you have a prosilica, you should be able use the ./launch/camera.launch 
		by changing only the ip_address. 
	2. Make sure your robot is publishing its pose [/msrCartPos]
		Special Case: KUKA-LWR/FRI/OROCOS users can use ./launch/handEyeCalibration.launch. 
		After launching jump to Step 4.
	3. Launch ./launch/handEyeCalibration.launch
		This will launch the camera (./launch/camera.launch) and the handEyeCalibration node. 
	4. Move you robot inside the visible range and take several measurements. 
		[Note: It is recommended to stop (velocity=0) the robot before recording measurements]  
		4.1. Left mouse click on the image window to record a measurement.
		4.2. Press 'q' to delete current measurement if you are not satisfied.
			You may have to do this in case the checkerboard was poorly detected.
		4.3. If you are satisfied with the current measurement, press any key, except 'q', to continue. 
		4.4. Move the robot again and continue taking around 15~20 measurements. 
	5. Right mouse click on the image window to estimate the Transformation of the camera frame 
		with respect to the robot tool-tip.
			
Developers: 
	If you want to implement a new estimation algorithm use the 
	CalibrationObject.generateData();
	CalibrationObject.performEstimation();
	inside the main to avoid running the robot/camera every time you want to test.
